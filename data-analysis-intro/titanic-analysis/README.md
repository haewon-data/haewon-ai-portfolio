# ðŸ›³ Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This repository contains a two-part data science project using the Titanic dataset.

- **Project 1**: Beginner-friendly end-to-end model development  
  _(Public Kaggle score: **0.79186** using GradientBoostingClassifier)_
- **Project 2**: Advanced experiments including tuning and ensembling  
  _(to be developed incrementally following Project 1 completion)_

## ðŸ“ˆ Beyond This Project

After completing both parts of this project, future directions could include:

- Applying this workflow to new datasets beyond Titanic  
- Exploring AutoML frameworks and deep learning techniques  
- Publishing full-scale projects following this documented structure
